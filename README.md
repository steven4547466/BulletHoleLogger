A bullet hole logger, 3d viewer, and bot for viewing. The bot and plugin rely on the website being up and accepting get/post requests to `/bullets` (which is all good by default, just `npm start` in the web server's root directory to start it.

Feel free to PR changes to any of the 3 parts of this repo (plugin, web server, or bot). Or make feature requests, idk if I'll add them tho. Just don't annoy me about it because I will just private it if too many people annoy me about it.
